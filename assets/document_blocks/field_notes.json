  "commentary": "I'm a researcher at Calculus House, in a partnership with the Residency. My work is in stretchy electronics for human augmentation, or stretch MEMS. \n\nI'm driven by a desire for external regulation of sensation, which I find almost as troubling to consider as another might, but much more fascinating and realistic than perhaps anyone else.",

The system successfully interprets subvocalized speech patterns and converts them to text output.
